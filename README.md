# ML-and-DL-for-Intrusion-Detection
# 🔐 Intrusion Detection in IoT using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project applies various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to detect network intrusions in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. It leverages the **CICIoT2023** dataset to train and evaluate models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and VGGNet.
